# DJS09: Couch Surfing | Typescript Practice

## Challenge Overview

Are you ready to get stuck into some Typescript? For this challenge, you are required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: Couch Surfing Website

For this challenge you are required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: Learn Typescript Tutorial

The focus for this project will be to understand the concepts around a JavaScript superset like Typescript and to get a feel for how it works. You will need to submit the finished Couch Surfing Website as your DJS09 Submission.

## Understanding the Starter Code Setup

The starter code in this repository is set up using Vite instead of Webpack due to some technical issues. This means that the folder structure is slightly different from what you may have seen in the Scrimba course. However, all the necessary files for your project are still included.

### Key Differences in Folder Structure:

- The `index.html` file is still located at the **root** of the project (as before).
- The `index.ts` and `index.css` files are now inside the **src** folder.
- When adding new files (such as TypeScript or CSS files), make sure to place them **inside the `src` folder**.
- Be careful when linking images! Since `index.ts` is inside the `src` folder, you may need to adjust the **relative paths** to images correctly.

## How to Get Started

1. Download or Clone this starter repository.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the required dependencies.
3. Start the development server by running:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. A local development link will appear in the terminal:
   ```arduino
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```
   **Tip**: Hold `Ctrl` and **Left Click** on the link to open it in your browser.
5. Start coding! As you add new features, **commit your changes** regularly to track progress.

**ðŸš¨ Note: You will need to make GitHub commits to your project after each lesson in the Scrimba walkthrough, showing that you have followed along with the lessons.**

Make sure to submit your project on the LMS Project Tab [DJS09]
